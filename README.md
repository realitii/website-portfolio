# Website Portfolio

This repository will document the progressive changes to the template portfolio as I progress through the program.


OVERVIEW:

I will make various sweeping changes to this repository, but it will follow the template design to enable the course outline to be meaningful. This portfolio page will not be a final design, but will show the progression in code quality and technical details. At some point, I will diverge from this portfolio to create a separate repository for my real portfolio page. It will be more meaningful to see the prior and finished portfolio pages in contrast, than to simply obscure this project in a complete revision hidden in commits and previous pull requests.

GOALS:

-	I will use Git effectively. I will try and make meaningful and atomized commits, and I will try to make meaningful branches for each task in the CareerFoundry Bootcamp.
-	I want to create a unique but analagous portfolio page to the CareerFoundry course design, but eventually abandon it for something completely unique.
-	The core elements that I create for this portfolio will not be abandoned. Instead, most of the React elements in this portfolio will become a subdomain of the formal portfolio page that I later create.

FUTURE PORTFOLIO PAGE:

Root domain of my final portfolio page is written in Native HTML/CSS/JS

Subdomains e.g. (Projects, About Me, etc) are written in various different frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Solid, etc. Instead of creating a portfolio page that tells potential recruiters what I can do, I show them various meaningful demos of what I can do. It will feel like a continuous webpage, but will have multiple independent repositories for these subdomains. I will use WebAssembly.
